# Diving into a Database

## Using SQL(ite), R and Stencila

We will be working with the [San Francisco Restaurant Health Inspections](http://2016.padjo.org/tutorials/sqlite-data-starterpacks/#more-info-san-francisco-restaurant-health-inspections "null") database.

We read from its description: "The San Francisco Dept. of Public Healthâ€™s database of eateries, inspections of those eateries, and violations found during the inspections."

Let's start by querying the `sqlite_master` (present in every sqlite database) table to get a list of the tables in the database,

```sql
--!
SELECT * FROM sqlite_master
```

Which are the businesses committing the most violations? Let's count the number of violation for business using SQL and then plot the result in R:

```sql
--! vpb =
SELECT business_id, description, count(ViolationTypeID) AS number_crimes
FROM violations
GROUP BY business_id, ViolationTypeID
LIMIT 20
```

```r
#! (vpb)
ggplot(vpb, aes(x=business_id, y=number_crimes)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity')
 ```
